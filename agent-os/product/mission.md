# AI Operation Center - Mission Document

## 🎯 Product Vision

To create a unified orchestration hub that leverages the Agent OS 3-Layer Context to enforce strict standards and security guardrails across the entire AI development lifecycle.

## 🏗️ Core Philosophy

We believe that AI development should be both powerful and secure. Our mission is to provide a seamless workflow that enables developers to move efficiently between specialized tools while maintaining enterprise-grade security and compliance.

## 🔄 The Three-Phase Workflow

### 🌊 Phase 1: Build (Windsurf)
**Purpose**: Heavy lifting and initial development
- Leverage Windsurf's advanced AI agents for rapid prototyping
- Utilize full project visibility across the agent-os/ folder
- Generate initial code, files, and folder structures
- Apply 3-Layer Context for intelligent generation

### 🧪 Phase 2: Experiment (Anti-Gravity)
**Purpose**: High-speed brainstorming and testing
- Use Gemini's massive context window for edge case analysis
- Rapid "what-if" scenario testing
- Experimental feature validation
- Sandbox environment for innovation

### 🔐 Phase 3: Polish & Audit (VS Code)
**Purpose**: Final security review and production readiness
- Comprehensive manual code review
- Security audit with specialized extensions (Snyk, etc.)
- Final quality assurance
- Production deployment preparation
