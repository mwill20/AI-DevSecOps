# Security Standards Validator - Raw Idea

**Feature Description**: Security Standards Validator

**User's Vision**: 
As the Architect, I want to create a "Security Standards Validator" as our first feature for the AI Operation Center. This will be a critical component that enforces the Agent OS 3-Layer Context security guardrails across all three phases of our workflow (Build in Windsurf, Experiment in Anti-Gravity, Polish & Audit in VS Code).

**Key Context**:
- This is part of our unified orchestration hub vision
- Must integrate with Agent OS 3-Layer Context standards
- Needs to provide security checkpoints between workflow phases
- Should maintain enterprise-grade security and compliance
- Must support audit trails and comprehensive logging

**Initial Thoughts**:
- Should validate code against security standards before phase transitions
- Must integrate with Windsurf, Anti-Gravity, and VS Code
- Needs real-time vulnerability scanning
- Should provide security scoring and risk assessment
- Must generate compliance reports

**Date Created**: 2026-01-20
**Architect**: User (acting as Architect)
**Phase**: Shape Spec - Requirements Gathering
